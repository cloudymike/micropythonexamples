# Micropython examples

This repo includes a number of small examples
for MicroPython, that are developed and tested
on set of MicroPython supported boards. Most of 
these are in "Hello World" size. The idea is 
to be able to use these examples to quickly get
something working, and to document research done
on pin out diagrams, software versions and more.
