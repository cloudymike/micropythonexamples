# Ideas of projects to do

## WIFI example
Some simple test or demo. Telnet control of LED?

## MQTT
Examples:
* https://micropython-iot-hackathon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mqtt.html
* https://pycom.io/get-started-subscribing-and-publishing-messages-in-micropython-using-mqtt/
Create example of pub/sub
* publish: Type input to publish or temperature
* subscribe: LED control

Use MQTT cli (mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub)

## AWS MQTT
Same as MQTT but with AWS setup
Use this as example: https://awsiot.wordpress.com/2019/01/10/connect-8266-to-aws-mqtt-using-miropython/

* publish: Type input to publish or temperature
* subscribe: LED control
